# SSToolkit

Welcome to the SSToolkit, the comprehensive suite of tools designed for the modern domain-driven design (DDD) application. This toolkit is crafted to assist developers in implementing robust, scalable, and maintainable software architectures using the .NET 8.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design Application**: Facilitate the development of complex applications by focusing on the core business domain.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern to separate read and write operations for more scalable and maintainable code.
- **Specification Pattern**: Define business rules or criteria in a reusable way and decouple the code for querying data from the business logic.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract the data layer with repository interfaces to promote a more testable and maintainable application structure.
- **Event Sourcing**: Persist the state of a business entity as a sequence of state-altering events.
- **Entity Framework Tools**: Leverage ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify data access and manipulation.
- **Email Tools**: Integrate email functionalities seamlessly within your application.
- **Cryptography Tools**: Ensure data security with robust encryption and decryption services.
